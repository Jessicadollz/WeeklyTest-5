# Book App

This is a simple Book App project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Book App allows users to keep track of their reading list by adding, removing, and marking books as read.

- **Mark Books as Read/Unread**: Users can mark books as read or unread. This feature helps users keep track of which books they have finished reading.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
